GC Analog Input

 This serves as a simple data capture routine from a
 1.0 V serial output of HP 5890 Series II gas chromatograph.

 The circuit:
 * 1 V analog input into A0
 * Two Off-(On) buttons are connected to Digital input 7 (start)
 * and 8 (stop)
 * One side of each button is attached to +5V 
 * The other side of each button is in parallel with digital input
 * and a 1K ohm pull-down resistor hooked to ground
 * An LED is hooked up to Digital output 2 in series 
 * with a 470 ohm resistor
