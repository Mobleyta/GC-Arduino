GC-Arduino Project

The GC Arduino Program is an interface program that allows a PC/Mac/Linux system
to communicate with an Arduino that is connected to one or more gas chromatography
instruments.

The project consists of two main programming parts, the Arduino code that is uploaded to
an Arduino Uno (Rev 3) and the python code that is implemented on the computer. Serial
interface through a USB port allows the two programs to communicate.

GC Analog Input on Arduino

 Program: ./ArduinoCode/GCDualInstrumentsSimul/GCDualInstrumentsSimul.ino
 Upload to Arduino using Arduino software
 
 This serves as a simple data capture routine from a
 1.0 V serial output of HP 5890 Series II gas chromatograph.

 Current Version: Complete with two channels, multiple runs,

 The circuit:
 See Frizzing diagram for description of circuit.  GCAnalogInputCircuitADS2ChanFinal.fzz

 Uses Adafruit breakout of ADS1115 Texas Instruments 16-Bit ADC

 Two different analog signals from GCs can be accommodated simultaneously

 Each signal has a separate Start/Stop Button
  Signal 1
    A0 input on ADS1115
    Start button on IO pin 9
    Stop button on IO pin 3
    Greed LED on IO pin 6
   Signal 2
    A1 input on ADS1115
    Start button on IO pin 8
    Stop button on IO pin 2
    Greed LED on IO pin 5

 based upon GCDualInsruments code

Serial Input from Arduino

  Program: ./PythonCode/GCReaderTK.py
  Run using python3
  
  This program serves as the master program linking multiple modules implementing various
  aspects of the program. Starting it loads a TK window that controls all program
  functions.
  
  A global variables file ./PythonCode/gcardglobals.py allows modification of the default
  settings of the program.
